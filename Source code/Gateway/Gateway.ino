  It is the intellectual property of the company and is intended only for demonstration purposes.

  The gateway is designed to communicate with the device as part of the IoT system.
  For interested parties, the demo video (version 0) explains how the gateway and device operate,
  as well as how communication between them is established.

  Unfortunately, the actual source code cannot be shared here :( 
  Only the program structure is provided as a placeholder.

void setup() {
  // Initialization code for the gateway would go here
}

void loop() {
  // Main program logic for the gateway would go here
}
