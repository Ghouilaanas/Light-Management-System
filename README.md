# ðŸ’¡ Light-Management-System
Conducted as part of an **end-of-studies project at SWATEK**, this work focused on the development of an **IoT-based smart public lighting solution**. A prototype was designed including two custom electronic boards, **Device** and **Gateway**, communicating wirelessly. The Gateway ensured data transmission to a dedicated server (**LIMASY**), which enabled system monitoring, control, and scenario-based management while ensuring security and connectivity.

## ðŸ“„ Description
This end-of-study project realized within the company SWATEK aims to design and create a system aimed at
developing an IoT solution for intelligent public lighting. In this context, a design of a prototype is implemented
while designing two electronic boards called Device and Gateway and while inserting a wireless communication
between them. The role of the Gateway is to let data pass via the LoRa protocol to another protocol called
the Internet. Indeed, all the information received at the Gateway is sent to the server created LIMASY using
the HTTPS protocol and then to the server application for visualization and control by scenarios.
This server created, provides everything necessary in terms of security, connectivity, and public lighting system management.

**Keywords** : IoT, LoRa, WiFi, HTTPS, STM32-Nucleo L476RG, STM32Cube IDE, C/C++.
